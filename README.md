# Tensor_with_Known_and_Random_Values

This repository contains Python scripts for working with TensorFlow, specifically focusing on creating tensors with known and random values. The examples demonstrate basic tensor operations, including addition and element-wise multiplication.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the examples:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have TensorFlow installed. You can install it using the following command:

    !pip install tensorflow --quiet

##Clone the Repository
###Clone this repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/aafiya-farveen/Tensor_with_Known_and_Random_Values.git

    cd Tensor_with_Known_and_Random_Values


##Run the TensorFlow Script
###Execute the Tensorflow.ipynb notebook to run the TensorFlow
